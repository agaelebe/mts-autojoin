# Mts-autojoin

This gem is a command line tool used to automatically join mts files from a given folder based on their file size using [ffmpeg concat demuxer](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate)

Usually AVCHD format (used in most camcorders) breaks long video files in 2 (or 4) gigabyte chunks with file names '00001.mts', '00002.mts', '00003.mts' and so on.

This is useful if your video editor sofware doesn't support AVCHD or need to reencode the files to edit them, which is much slower than just muxing them using ffmpeg.

## Installation

Please make sure you have installed ffmpeg command line tool and have it added to your path.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mts-autojoin'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mts-autojoin

## Usage

Execute:

  $ mts-autojoin <FOLDER_WITH_MTS_FILES>
